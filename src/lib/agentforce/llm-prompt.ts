`This task is to fix a violation raised from Code Analyzer, a static code analysis tool which analyzes Apex code.

The following json data contains:
    - codeContext: the full context of the code
    - violatingLines: the lines within the context of the code that have violated a rule
    - violationMessage: the violation message describing an issue with the violating lines
    - ruleName: the name of the rule that has been violated
    - ruleDescription: the description of the rule that has been violated

Here is the json data:
\`\`\`json
{{###INPUT_JSON_DATA###}}
\`\`\`

Given the information above, provide a JSON response following these instructions:
- Return a brief explanation for the changes you want to make in the 'explanation' field.
- Return the fixed code that exactly replaces the full original 'codeContext' in the 'fixedCode' field.
- The fixedCode field must only contain the exact code that can replace the original code context without any explanations.
- The fixedCode field must only fix the provided violation, and preserve the rest of the code.

The JSON response should follow the following schema:
\`\`\`json
${GUIDED_JSON_SCHEMA}
